# REACKT

REACKT (Rare Earth Actinides Constants & logK Thermodynamics) is an AI model designed to accurately predict reaction characteristics (such as logK values) involving rare earth elements (REEs) and actinides. Building upon advanced algorithms and a comprehensive dataset, REACKT provides reliable estimations that are vital for a range of scientific and industrial applications. Its innovative architecture not only ensures precise predictions but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between these elements and extracting agents – contributing to fundamental understanding of REEs and actinides’ selective binding. By optimizing and streamlining the predictive process, REACKT stands as a cornerstone in the advancement of research in applications that include REEs and actinides.
